The editor is written in Draft.js

- Typing `#` as the first string in a line & pressing space makes anything you type afterwards on the same line in a “Heading” format. On pressing space the aforementioned `#` gets disappear.

- Similarly, typing `*` as the first string in a line and pressing space corresponds to “bold” format

- typing `**` in a line and pressing space shows red line

- typing `***` in a line and pressing space shows underline

- Pressing `Save` button persists everything typed in the editor into `localstorage`. On refreshing the page,  the saved info is refilled into the editor.
